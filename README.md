# Fake News Detection

This project builds two systems to compare models in predicting Fake News. The models take into consideration, both, the title and the text, of an article in order to determine whether it is fake or not. The first system is developed on classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. The second system is built using PyTorch to develop a classifier using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, in short, BERT.
